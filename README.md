# PasswordGenerator

The user inputs parameters for the password - password length, characters used - and the application generates a password of random characters that meets the user requirements.

Things I learned/practiced:
- concatenate arrays
- join array so items appear without separators
- make text appear in the DOM using javascript
- for loop
- organization - isolating steps in separate functions

I added a "clear" button because it seemed useful. As a user, I would want the ability to clear the password from the screen so that the sensitive/personal information wasn't visible anymore.

The area I struggled most was realizing I had to reset arrays back to empty. When I would click "generate password" a second or third time without refreshing the page, the new password would just get added to the end of the previously generated one. That took a minute to figure out, but using the developer tools was helpful.

This assignment was a bit easier than last week's responsive design website because it was clear when this one was finished! :)
